\begin{enumerate}
    \item [1.] \textbf{For the following gure, (a) Is A independent of B given B and D in each
of the 3 cases? (b) Is B conditionally independent of D given A and C}
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{proof} 
Answer
\end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [2.] \textbf{Consider the problem discussed in class (Notes set 5-bn.pdf; the example
with heat disease etc.). Infer the probability that an individual has heart
disease given that the indivual has high blood pressure, has ahealth dietg
and exercise regularly}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
The MSE of the different polynomials will be displayed at the bottom of the plotted functions on the graph itself. These graphs are also the same graphs as sub-question D.

\end{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [3.] \textbf{Induce the Bayesian network topology for the following problem: Two
algorithms, A1 and A2 continually observe intrusions into a computer
network. Suppose, A1 indicates an intrusion while A2 does not. Sometimes
an intrusion is detected because the system administrator upgraded a
previous version of an application. Is there an intrusion? Make as many
reasonable assumptions as required.}
\end{enumerate} 
\begin{proof} 
The features that we will assume are present and affecting our computer network are - 
\begin{itemize}
  \item OS Version
  \item Software Version
  \item Internet Access
  \item USB Access
  \item Intrusion
\end{itemize}
The probability joint distribution will be as follows -
\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{IA} & \textbf{USB} \\
0.8 & 0.9
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{proof}
